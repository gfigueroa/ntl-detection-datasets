# NTL-Detection Datasets

Datasets for NTL (non-technical loss) detection used in the research paper "Improved practices in machine learning
algorithms for NTL detection with imbalanced data" (Figueroa et al.).

## Description

The datasets are contained in 2 separate directories, each corresponding to one of the preprocessing steps:

2. Filtered
3. Aggregated

Scripts to perform the preprocessing steps are included in (2) and (3).
Zip files must first be decompressed.
After running the script in step (3), you should obtain the final dataset used for training and testing.

## Translations

The datasets and scripts contain some Spanish words related to fraud and NTL.
Below is a translation list for the most common ones found:

* hurto: fraud
* no hurto: no fraud
* medidor: smart meter

## Acknowledgment

These datasets are free for research use.
If you find them useful or use them in your research, please acknowledge my git repository and paper!
